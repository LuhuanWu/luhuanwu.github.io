Hi, I am a 4th-year PhD student in Statistics at <a href="https://www.columbia.edu/">Columbia University</a>,
where I am very fortunate to work with Prof. <a href="https://stat.columbia.edu/~cunningham/">John Cunningham</a>. and Prof. <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~blei/index.html">David Blei</a>. During my PhD, I've interned at [Apple MLR](https://machinelearning.apple.com/) hosted by [Sinead Williamson](https://sinead.github.io/). Previously, I received my master's degree in Data Science at Columbia University, supervised by Prof. John Cunningham and Prof. <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~itsik/">Itsik Pe'er</a>. I received my bachelor's degree in Mathematics at <a href="https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/main.psp">Nanjing University</a>.

__Research Interests__: In general I am interested in problems that invovle randomness and uncertainty, mostly through a probabilistic lens. Specifically, my recent focus has been: 

- Probabilistic modeling: deep generative models (e.g. diffusion models, VAE, deep state space models), and Bayesian inference (e.g. variational inference, SMC)
- Uncertainty quantification: I've been mostly exploring the Bayesian approach, but I'm also open to other approaches
- Invariant prediction and out-of-distribution generalization
