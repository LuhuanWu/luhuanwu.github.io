Hi, I am a 5th-year PhD student in Statistics at <a href="https://www.columbia.edu/">Columbia University</a>,
where I am very fortunate to work with Prof. <a href="https://stat.columbia.edu/~cunningham/">John Cunningham</a>. and Prof. <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~blei/index.html">David Blei</a>. During my PhD, I've interned at [Apple MLR](https://machinelearning.apple.com/) hosted by [Sinead Williamson](https://sinead.github.io/). Previously, I received my master's degree in Data Science at Columbia University, supervised by Prof. John Cunningham and Prof. <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~itsik/">Itsik Pe'er</a>. I received my bachelor's degree in Mathematics at <a href="https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/">Nanjing University</a>.

I will join <a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-mathematics/">CCM at Flatiron Institute</a> as an associate research scientist this summer, and will join the <a href="https://engineering.jhu.edu/ams/">Department of Applied Math and Statistics</a> at Johns Hopkins University as an assistant professor in July 2026. 

__Research Interests__: In general I am interested in problems that invovle randomness and uncertainty, mostly through a probabilistic lens. Specifically, my recent focus has been: 

- Probabilistic machine learning: deep generative models, approximate inference, Bayesian modeling, uncertainty quantification. 
- Invariant prediction and out-of-distribution generalization
