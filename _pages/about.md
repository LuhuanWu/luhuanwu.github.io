I am an associate research scientist in the [Center for Computational Mathematics](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-mathematics/) at the Flatiron Institute. I will be joining the [Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ams/) at Johns Hopkins University as an Assistant Professor in July, 2026.

I did my Ph.D. in [Statistics](https://stat.columbia.edu/) at Columbia University, supervised by [John Cunningham](https://sites.stat.columbia.edu/cunningham/) and [David Blei](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~blei/). Before that, I received an M.S. in [Data Science](https://datascience.columbia.edu/) also from Columbia, and a B.S. in [Mathematics](https://njunju.nju.edu.cn/EN/7f/77/c7136a163703/page.htm) from Nanjing University.

Here is my [CV](../assets/pdf/LuhuanWu_CV.pdf).
