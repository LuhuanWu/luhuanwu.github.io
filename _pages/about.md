Hi, I am a third-year PhD student in Statistics at <a href="https://www.columbia.edu/">Columbia University</a>,
where I am very fortunate to work with Prof. <a href="https://stat.columbia.edu/~cunningham/">John Cunningham</a>. and Prof. <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~blei/index.html">David Blei</a>. Previously, I received my master's degree in Data Science at Columbia University, supervised by Prof. John Cunningham and Prof. <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~itsik/">Itsik Pe'er</a>. I received my bachelor's degree in Mathematics at <a href="https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/main.psp">Nanjing University</a>.

__Research Interests__: I have broad research interests in machine learning and statistics. My recent focus has been:

- Probabilistic Machine Learning: latent variable models, deep generative models, variational inference

- Uncertainty Quantification: Bayesian modeling, conformal prediction

- Causal Inference: invariant prediction, out-of-distribution generalization
